# Mattias Pilroth

I work on the strategic and technical foundations of cybersecurity in
safety-critical industrial environments.

My focus is on designing resilient OT architectures that hold up when
enterprise IT requirements collide with operational reality, long system
lifecycles, and constrained connectivity.

Rather than isolated controls, I focus on foundations: identity, trust,
network boundaries, and risk management models that can be sustained by the
line organization over time.

## Areas of focus

- **Industrial identity and access**  
  OT Active Directory architecture, hardening, lifecycle management,
  and separation from enterprise IT identity.

- **Network architecture and boundaries**  
  Secure DMZ patterns, segmentation, and zone-and-conduit design aligned
  with IEC 62443.

- **Risk management and control selection**  
  Structuring OT risk assessments, identifying realistic threat and
  failure scenarios, and translating risk into appropriate technical
  and organizational controls.

- **Governance enablement**  
  Translating regulatory intent (for example NIS2) into concrete,
  operationally viable engineering requirements.

## Public technical notes

I use selected public repositories to document architectural reasoning,
technical edge cases, and failure modes encountered in real OT
environments.

- **ot-security-notes**  
  Conceptual and analytical notes on OT-specific system behavior, risk,
  and failure modes where traditional IT security assumptions break down.

- **ot-trust-in-isolated-networks**  
  A focused deep-dive into PKI, certificate validation, and trust
  management in isolated or connectivity-constrained OT environments.
