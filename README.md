# Mattias Pilroth

I work with the strategic and technical foundations of cybersecurity in
safety-critical industrial environments.

My focus is on designing resilient OT architectures that hold up when
enterprise IT requirements collide with operational reality, long system
lifecycles, and constrained connectivity.

Rather than isolated controls, I focus on foundations: identity, trust,
network boundaries, and risk management models that can be sustained by the
line organization over time.

## Core areas

- **Industrial identity and access**  
  OT Active Directory architecture, hardening, lifecycle management,
  and separation from enterprise IT identity.

- **Network architecture and defense**  
  Secure DMZ patterns, segmentation, and zone-and-conduit design aligned
  with IEC 62443.

- **Risk management and control selection**  
  Structuring OT risk assessments, identifying realistic threat and
  failure scenarios, and translating risk into appropriate technical
  and organizational controls.

- **Governance and compliance enablement**  
  Translating NIS2 and other regulatory frameworks into concrete,
  operationally viable engineering requirements.

## Public technical notes

I use selected public repositories to document technical edge cases,
architectural trade-offs, and failure modes encountered in real OT
environments.

- **ot-trust-in-isolated-networks**  
  Architectural reasoning around PKI, certificate validation, and trust
  management when connectivity cannot be assumed.

- **ot-security-notes**  
  Ongoing reflections on OT-specific system behavior, soft failures,
  and why traditional IT security assumptions often fail in industrial systems.
